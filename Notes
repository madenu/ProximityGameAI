### Possible Heuristics
* Consider the number of edge territories
    * Consider how many fixed or walled-in territories there are
    * Consider how difficult it would be to break through a wall

### Implementation
* Should we incorporate Markov Decision Process to determine difficulty of breaking through a wall?
* Could use different agents for different difficulty levels of the game
